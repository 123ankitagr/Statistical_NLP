most 
of 
the 
area 
was 
originally 
swampland 
which 
was 
gradually 
drained 
and 
irrigated 
for 
agriculture 
by 
the 
construction 
of 
canals 
khlong 
which 
took 
place 
from 
the 
16th 
to 
19th 
centuries 
the 
course 
of 
the 
river 
as 
it 
flows 
through 
bangkok 
has 
been 
modified 
by 
the 
construction 
of 
several

canalsthe 
citys 
waterway 
network 
served 
as 
the 
primary 
means 
of 
transport 
until 
the 
late 
19th 
century 
when 
modern 
roads 
began 
to 
be 
built 
up 
until 
then 
most 
people 
lived 
near 
or 
on 
the 
water 
leading 
the 
city 
to 
be 
known 
during 
the 
19th 
century 
as 
the

many 
of 
these 
canals 
have 
since 
been 
filled

or 
paved 
over 
but 
others 
still 
crisscross 
the

most

are 
now 
badly

geology 
of

which 
overlies 
an

this

by 
extensive 
ground

first 
recognized

the

is 
the 
subject 
of 
two 
different 
legends 
the 
first 
attributes 
the 
founding 
of

to 
the

the 
historical 
carthaginian 
general

in

it

be 
gathered 
from

985 
barcelona 
was 
sacked 
by 
the

barcelona 
remained 
the

at 
the 
heart 
of 
a

was 
relatively 
industrialised 
and 
prosperous 
despite 
the 
devastation 
of 
the

the 
result 
was 
a 
largescale 
immigration 
from 
poorer 
regions 
of 
spain 
particularly 
andalusia 
murcia

which 
in

massive

reputation

the

in

this

on

by 
spanish 
conquistador 
gonzalo 
jiménez 
de 
quesada 
after 
a 
harsh 
expedition 
into 
the

conquering 
the 
muisca 
the 
muisca 
were 
the 
indigenous 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
region 
and 
they 
called 
the 
place 
of 
the 
foundation 
thybzaca 
or 
old 
town 
the 
name 
of 
bogotá 
corresponds 
to 
the 
spanish 
pronunciation 
of 
the 
muisca 
bacatá 
or 
mueketá 
which 
was 
the 
name 
of 
a 
neighboring 
settlement 
located 
between 
the 
modern 
towns 
of 
funza 
and 
cota 
there 
are 
different 
opinions 
about 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
word 
bacatá 
the 
most 
accepted 
being 
that 
it 
means 
walling 
of 
the 
farmland 
in 
the 
chibcha 
language 
another 
popular 
translation 
argues 
that 
it 
means 
the 
lady 
of 
the 
andes 
further 
the 
word 
andes 
in 
the 
aymara 
language 
means 
shining 
mountain 
thus 
rendering 
the 
full 
lexical 
signification 
of 
bogotá 
as 
the 
lady 
of 
the 
shining 
mountain 
notice 
however 
that 
the 
language 
of 
the 
muisca 
people 
was 
not 
aymara 
but 
chibcha 
others 
suggest 
that 
bacatá 
was 
the 
name 
of 
the 
muisca 
cacique 
who 
governed 
the 
land 
before 
the 
spaniards 
arrived 
jiménez 
de 
quesada 
gave 
the 
settlement 
the 
name 
of 
our

gave 
it

it

in 
many 
different 
ways 
accelerating

one 
of 
the 
most 
transcendent 
was 
the

was 
an 
intellectually 
curious

deeply 
impressed 
by 
both 
the 
insurrection

the 
execution 
nariño 
went 
on 
to 
become 
a 
politician 
in 
santafé 
and 
he 
became 
acquainted 
with 
the 
liberal 
ideas 
in 
vogue 
in 
europe 
he 
started 
organizing 
clandestine 
meetings 
with 
other

politicians 
to 
discuss

promote

copies

started 
creating 
a 
stirring 
in 
the 
political 
mentalities 
of 
the 
time 
the 
spanish 
government 
had 
banned 
the

the 
year

those 
suspected 
of

also 
persecuted

of 
the 
most 
important 
interventions 
in 
the 
city 
for 
this 
time 
was 
its 
transportation 
system 
in 
1967 
there 
were 
2679 
urban 
buses 
in 
bogotá 
that 
transported 
on

1629254 
passengers 
per

had 
a 
little 
more 
than 
a 
million 
inhabitants 
and 
8000 
hectares 
in 
length 
the 
service 
was 
relatively 
reasonable 
and 
comfortable 
but 
as 
the 
city 
grew 
and 
reached 
more 
than 
five 
million 
inhabitants 
and 
an 
area 
greater 
than 
30000 
hectares 
not 
only 
did 
the 
car 
fleet 
increase 
substantially 
to 
reach 
more 
than 
20000 
vehicles 
but 
chaos 
multiplied 
as 
well 
as 
pollution 
and 
the 
inefficiency 
of 
the 
only 
existing 
transportation 
systemby 
the 
end 
of 
the 
20th 
century 
the 
situation 
was 
critical 
there 
was 
no 
real 
urban 
public 
transport 
system 
that 
would 
serve 
as 
an 
alternative 
to 
the 
private 
vehicle 
which 
further 
incentivized 
its 
use 
and 
the 
city 
had 
low 
levels 
of 
competitiveness 
in 
latin

covered 
the

from

in 
1892 
the 
line 
connecting 
plaza

station 
started 
operating 
the 
tramway 
ran 
over 
wooden 
rails

was 
easily 
derailed 
so 
steel 
rails 
imported 
from

were 
eventually 
installed

the

eventually 
grew 
to

but 
during 
the 
bogotazo 
riots 
of 
1948 
the 
system 
suffered 
heavy 
damage 
and 
was 
forced 
to 
close 
the 
economic 
effects 
of 
the 
subsequent 
civil 
war 
that 
followed 
prevented 
the

from 
being

parts

they 
were

by

bostons 
penchant

along 
with

growing 
distrust

fostered 
a

in

force 
them 
to 
accept 
the

established 
by

the

was 
a

event 
leading

one 
of 
the

be 
influenced 
by 
the

style 
of

was 
hungary

budapest 
in

the

appeared 
following 
the 
marriage 
of

in

many 
italian

came 
to 
buda 
with 
the

queen 
today 
many 
of 
the 
original 
renaissance 
buildings 
disappeared 
during 
the 
varied 
history 
of

but 
budapest 
is 
still 
rich 
in 
renaissance

neorenaissance 
buildings 
like

in

multiple 
mosques

were 
built 
in

these 
were 
great 
examples 
of 
ottoman 
architecture 
which 
was 
influenced 
by

from 
around 
the

including 
turkish 
iranian

after 
the

conquered 
budapest 
they 
replaced 
most 
of 
the 
mosques 
with

minarets 
were 
turned 
into 
bell 
towers 
and 
cathedral 
spires 
at 
one 
point 
the 
distinct 
sloping 
central 
square 
in 
budapest 
became 
a

was 
filled 
with

of 
camel

on 
their

budapest 
is 
in

one

turks 
came

the

tourists 
also 
visit 
cape 
towns 
beaches 
which 
are 
popular 
with 
local 
residents 
due 
to 
the 
citys 
unique 
geography 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
visit 
several 
different 
beaches 
in 
the 
same 
day 
each 
with 
a 
different 
setting 
and 
atmosphere 
though 
the 
capes 
water 
ranges 
from 
cold 
to 
mild 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
sides 
of 
the 
city 
is 
dramatic 
while 
the 
atlantic 
seaboard 
averages 
annual 
water 
temperatures 
barely 
above 
that 
of

california 
around 
13

the

is 
much 
warmer 
averaging 
between 
16 
and 
17 
°c 
61 
and 
63 
°f 
annually 
this 
is 
similar 
to

temperatures 
in 
much 
of

for 
example 
nice 
in

false

water 
averages 
slightly 
over 
20 
°c 
68 
°f 
with 
22 
°c 
72 
°f 
a 
common 
high 
beaches 
located 
on 
the 
atlantic 
coast 
tend 
to 
have 
very 
cold 
water 
due 
to 
the 
benguela 
current 
which 
originates 
from 
the 
southern 
ocean 
whilst 
the 
water 
at 
false 
bay 
beaches 
may 
be 
warmer 
by 
up 
to 
10 
°c 
18 
°f 
at 
the 
same 
moment 
due 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
warm 
agulhas 
current 
it 
is 
a 
common 
misconception 
that 
false 
bay 
is 
part 
of 
the 
indian 
ocean 
with 
cape 
point 
being 
both 
the 
meeting 
point 
of 
the 
indian 
and 
atlantic 
oceans 
and 
the 
southernmost 
tip 
of 
africa 
the 
oceans 
in 
fact 
meet 
at 
the 
actual 
southernmost 
tip 
cape 
agulhas 
which 
lies 
approximately 
150 
kilometres 
93 
miles 
to 
the 
south 
east 
the 
misconception 
is 
fuelled 
by 
the 
relative 
warmth 
of 
the 
false 
bay 
water 
to 
the 
atlantic 
seaboard 
water 
and 
the 
many 
confusing 
instances 
of

in

synonymous 
with

much

it

political

conditions 
of 
chicago 
nonetheless 
chicagoans 
worked 
hard 
to 
create 
a 
literary 
tradition 
that 
would 
stand 
the 
test

there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
myths

legends 
associated 
with 
the 
origin 
of 
the

delhi 
one 
of 
them 
is 
derived 
from 
dhillu 
or 
dilu 
a 
king 
who 
built 
a 
city 
at 
this 
location 
in 
50 
bce 
and 
named 
it 
after 
himself 
another 
legend 
holds 
that 
the 
name 
of 
the 
city 
is 
based 
on 
the 
hindiprakrit 
word 
dhili 
loose 
and 
that 
it 
was 
used 
by 
the 
tomaras 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
city 
because 
the 
iron 
pillar 
of 
delhi 
had 
a 
weak 
foundation 
and 
had 
to 
be 
moved 
according 
to 
panjab 
notes 
and 
queries 
the 
name 
of 
the 
city 
at 
the 
time 
of 
king 
prithviraj 
was 
dilpat 
and 
that 
dilpat 
and 
dilli 
are 
probably 
derived 
from 
the 
old 
hindi 
word 
dil 
meaning 
eminence 
the 
former 
director 
of 
the 
archaeological 
survey 
of 
india 
alexander 
cunningham 
mentioned 
that 
dilli 
later 
became 
dihlidehli 
some 
suggest 
the 
coins 
in 
circulation 
in 
the 
region 
under 
the 
tomaras 
were 
called 
dehliwal 
according 
to 
the 
bhavishya

built

dehali 
some 
historians 
believe 
that 
dhilli 
or 
dhillika 
is 
the 
original 
name 
for 
the 
city 
while 
others 
believe 
the 
name 
could 
be 
a 
corruption 
of 
the 
hindustani 
words 
dehleez 
or 
dehali—both 
terms 
meaning 
threshold

clyde 
in

form 
of

city

the

respectivelyby 
backformation 
the 
term 
burger 
eventually 
became 
a 
selfstanding 
word 
that 
is 
associated 
with 
many 
different 
types 
of 
sandwiches 
similar 
to 
a 
ground 
meat 
hamburger 
but 
made 
of 
different 
meats 
such 
as

meatless 
sandwiches 
as 
is 
the 
case 
of

history 
there 
have 
been 
many 
claims 
about

of

the

up 
one 
problem 
is 
that 
there

another

is 
that 
the

from 
tiny 
vendors 
that 
came

went 
in 
an 
instant 
and 
it 
is 
entirely 
possible 
that 
more 
than 
one 
person 
came 
up 
with

how 
constantinople

city 
in

the 
importance 
of 
constantinople 
in 
the

world

also 
reflected 
by 
its

name

the

an 
alternative 
view 
is 
that 
the

evolved 
directly 
from

according 
to 
early 
spanish 
articles 
the

was 
once 
called

after 
its 
original 
inhabitants 
however 
even 
before 
the 
inca 
occupation 
of 
the 
area 
in 
the 
15th 
century 
a 
famous 
oracle 
in 
the 
rímac 
valley 
had 
come 
to 
be 
known 
by 
visitors 
as 
limaq 
limaq 
pronounced 
ˈlimɑq 
which 
means 
talker 
or 
speaker 
in 
the 
coastal 
quechua 
that 
was 
the 
areas 
primary 
language 
before 
the 
spanish 
arrival 
this 
oracle 
was 
eventually 
destroyed 
by 
the 
spanish 
and 
replaced 
with 
a 
church 
but 
the 
name 
persisted 
the

scholars 
speculate 
that 
the

lima 
originated 
as 
the 
spanish 
pronunciation 
of 
the 
native

limaq 
linguistic 
evidence

spanish 
consistently 
rejects

nonperuvian 
spanish

founded 
in

under 
the 
name 
city 
of

because 
its

was 
decided 
on 
6 
january 
date 
of 
the 
feast 
of 
the 
epiphany 
this 
name 
quickly 
fell 
into

river 
that 
feeds 
lima 
is 
called 
rímac

many 
people 
erroneously

this

its

is 
talking 
river 
the 
incas 
spoke 
a 
highland 
variety

the

pronounced 
ˈrimɑq 
however 
the 
original 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
valley 
were 
not 
incas 
this 
name 
is 
an 
innovation 
arising 
from 
an 
effort 
by 
the 
cuzco 
nobility 
in 
colonial 
times 
to 
standardize 
the 
toponym 
so 
that 
it 
would 
conform

quechualater 
as 
the 
original 
inhabitants 
died 
out 
and 
the 
local 
quechua 
became 
extinct 
the

pronunciation 
prevailed 
nowadays 
spanishspeaking 
locals 
do 
not 
see 
the

the

environmental

one 
such

the

periodic

temperatures 
deplete 
melbournes

may 
exacerbate 
the

of 
these 
factors 
during

the

further

were 
required 
in

neither 
project 
was 
used 
extensively 
before

porfirian 
architecture 
became 
very 
influenced 
by 
paris 
haussmannizationduring 
this 
era 
of 
porfirian 
rule 
the 
city 
underwent 
an 
extensive 
modernization 
many 
spanish 
colonial 
style 
buildings 
were 
destroyed 
replaced 
by 
new 
much 
larger 
porfirian 
institutions 
and 
many 
outlying 
rural 
zones 
were 
transformed 
into 
urban 
or 
industrialized 
districts 
with 
most 
having 
electrical 
gas 
and 
sewage 
utilities 
by 
1908 
while 
the 
initial 
focus 
was 
on 
developing 
modern 
hospitals 
schools 
factories 
and 
massive 
public 
works 
perhaps 
the 
most 
longlasting 
effects 
of 
the 
porfirian 
modernization 
were 
creation 
of 
the 
colonia 
roma 
area 
and 
the 
development 
of

many 
of

major 
attractions

were 
built 
during

in

stylediazs 
plans 
called 
for 
the 
entire 
city 
to 
eventually 
be 
modernized 
or 
rebuilt 
in 
the 
porfirianfrench 
style 
of 
the

roma 
but 
the 
mexican 
revolution 
began 
soon 
afterward 
and 
the 
plans 
never 
came 
to 
fruition 
with 
many 
projects 
being 
left 
halfcompleted 
one 
of 
the 
best 
examples 
of 
this 
is 
the 
monument 
to 
the 
mexican 
revolution 
originally 
the 
monument 
was 
to 
be 
the 
main 
dome 
of 
diazs 
new 
senate 
hall 
but 
when 
the 
revolution 
erupted 
only 
the 
dome 
of 
the 
senate 
hall 
and 
its 
supporting 
pillars 
were 
completed 
this 
was 
subsequently 
seen 
as 
a 
symbol 
by 
many 
mexicans 
that 
the 
porfirian 
era 
was 
over 
once 
and 
for 
all 
and 
as 
such 
it 
was 
turned 
into

the 
most 
significant 
episode

an 
appointed

the 
municipalities 
within 
it 
were 
autonomous

this

created

more 
than 
a

1903 
porfirio 
díaz 
largely 
reduced 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
municipalities 
within 
the 
federal 
district 
eventually 
in 
december 
1928 
the 
federal 
government 
decided 
to 
abolish 
all 
the 
municipalities 
of 
the 
federal 
district 
in 
place 
of 
the 
municipalities 
the 
federal 
district 
was 
divided 
into 
one 
central 
department 
and 
13 
delegaciones 
boroughs 
administered 
directly 
by 
the 
government 
of 
the

the 
central 
department 
was 
integrated 
by 
the 
former 
municipalities 
of 
mexico 
city 
tacuba 
tacubaya 
and 
mixcoacin 
1941 
the 
general 
anaya 
borough 
was 
merged 
with 
the 
central 
department 
which 
was 
then 
renamed 
mexico

thus 
reviving 
the 
name 
but 
not 
the 
autonomous 
municipality 
from 
1941 
to 
1970 
the 
federal 
district 
comprised 
twelve 
delegaciones 
and 
mexico 
city 
in 
1970 
mexico 
city 
was 
split 
into 
four 
different 
delegaciones 
cuauhtémoc 
miguel 
hidalgo 
venustiano 
carranza 
and 
benito 
juárez 
increasing 
the 
number 
of 
delegaciones 
to 
16 
since 
then 
the 
whole 
federal 
district 
whose 
delegaciones 
had 
by 
then 
almost 
formed 
a 
single 
urban 
area 
began 
to 
be 
considered 
de 
facto 
a 
synonym 
of 
mexico 
citythe 
lack 
of 
a 
de 
jure 
stipulation 
left 
a 
legal 
vacuum 
that 
led 
to 
a 
number 
of 
sterile 
discussions 
about 
whether 
one 
concept 
had 
engulfed 
the 
other 
or 
if 
the 
latter 
had 
ceased 
to 
exist 
altogether 
in 
1993 
the 
situation 
was 
solved 
by 
an 
amendment 
to 
the 
44th 
article 
of 
the 
constitution 
of 
mexico 
mexico 
city 
and 
the 
federal 
district 
were 
stated 
to 
be 
the 
same 
entity 
the 
amendment 
was 
later 
introduced 
into 
the 
second 
article 
of 
the 
statute 
of 
government 
of 
the 
federal 
districton 
29

mexico 
city 
ceased 
to 
be 
the

district 
spanish 
distrito 
federal 
or 
df 
and 
was 
officially 
renamed 
ciudad 
de 
méxico 
or 
cdmx 
on 
that 
date 
mexico 
city 
began 
a 
transition 
to 
become 
the 
countrys 
32nd 
federal 
entity 
giving 
it 
a 
level 
of 
autonomy 
comparable 
to 
that 
of 
a 
state 
it 
will 
have 
its 
own 
constitution 
and 
its 
legislature 
and 
its 
delegaciones 
will 
now 
be 
headed 
by 
mayors 
because 
of 
a 
clause 
in 
the 
mexican 
constitution 
however 
as 
it 
is 
the 
seat 
of 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
federation 
it 
can 
never 
become 
a 
state 
or 
the 
capital 
of 
the

has 
to 
be 
relocated 
elsewheremexico 
city 
being 
the

the 
powers 
of 
the

belongs 
not 
to 
any 
particular 
state 
but 
to 
all 
of 
them 
therefore 
the 
president 
representing 
the

used 
to 
designate 
the

the 
federal

inconsistencies 
of

and 
dissatisfaction 
with 
the 
inadequate 
response 
of 
the 
federal 
government 
after 
the 
1985 
earthquake 
made 
residents 
begin 
to 
request 
political 
and 
administrative 
autonomy 
to 
manage 
their 
local 
affairs 
some 
political 
groups 
even 
proposed 
that 
the

be 
converted 
into 
the 
32nd 
state 
of 
the 
federationin 
response 
to 
the 
demands 
mexico 
city 
received 
a 
greater 
degree 
of 
autonomy 
with 
the 
1987 
elaboration

the 
creation 
of 
an

1990s 
this 
autonomy 
was 
further 
expanded

became 
increasingly 
difficult 
with

a

was 
still 
coming 
from

the

it

the

from

was 
the 
capital 
of 
the 
province

from 
1844 
to

lost 
its

queen 
victoria 
herself 
established 
ottawa 
as 
the

for 
strategic 
reasons 
the 
reasons 
were 
twofold 
as 
it 
was 
located 
more 
in 
the 
interior 
of 
the 
province 
of 
canada 
it 
was 
less 
susceptible 
to 
us 
attack 
perhaps 
more 
importantly 
as 
it 
lay 
on 
the 
border 
between 
french

canada 
the 
small

there 
was 
great 
resistance 
from

to 
the

perception 
being 
that 
it 
was 
forced 
on 
the 
mostly 
english 
suburbs 
by 
the 
parti 
québécois

proved 
unpopular

dates 
back

name 
is 
written 
大阪 
in

but 
it 
was 
written 
大坂 
until 
1870 
when 
the 
partisans 
for 
the 
meiji 
restoration 
changed 
it 
apparently 
to 
avoid

because 
of

the

many

to

foreign 
expatriates 
in 
the 
kansai 
region 
preferred 
to 
live 
in 
kobe 
rather 
than 
osaka 
as 
a 
result 
until 
1991 
the 
osaka

had 
no 
schools

a

there 
were 
about 
2500

urban 
historians 
since 
the 
late 
19th 
century 
and 
until 
the 
1940s 
são 
paulo 
was 
a 
condensed 
city 
in 
which 
different 
social 
groups 
lived 
in 
a 
small 
urban 
zone 
separated 
by 
type 
of 
housing 
from 
the 
1940s 
to 
the 
1980s 
são 
paulo 
followed 
a 
model 
of 
centerperiphery 
social 
segregation 
in 
which 
the

occupied 
central 
and 
modern 
areas 
while 
the 
poor 
moved 
towards 
precarious 
selfbuilt 
housing 
in 
the 
periphery 
and 
from 
the 
1980s 
onward 
new 
transformations 
have 
brought 
the 
social 
classes 
closer

são 
paulo 
differs 
considerably 
from 
other 
brazilian 
cities 
such 
as 
belo

whose 
initial 
expansion 
followed 
determinations 
by

a 
city 
like 
brasília 
whose 
master 
plan 
had 
been 
fully 
developed 
prior 
to

effectiveness 
of 
these 
plans 
has 
been 
seen 
by 
some 
planners 
and 
historians 
as 
questionable 
some 
of 
these 
scholars 
argue 
that 
such 
plans 
were 
produced 
exclusively 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
wealthier 
strata 
of 
the 
population 
while 
the 
working 
classes 
would 
be 
relegated 
to 
the 
traditional 
informal 
processes 
in 
são 
paulo 
until 
the 
mid1950s 
the 
plans 
were 
based 
on 
the 
idea

riverthe 
plan 
of 
the 
avenues 
was 
implemented 
during 
the 
1920s 
and 
sought 
to 
build 
large 
avenues 
connecting 
the 
city 
center 
with 
the 
outskirts 
this 
plan 
included 
renewing 
the 
commercial 
city 
center 
leading 
to 
real 
estate 
speculation 
and 
gentrification 
of 
several 
downtown 
neighborhoods 
the 
plan 
also 
led 
to 
the 
expansion 
of 
bus 
services 
which 
would 
soon 
replace 
the 
trolley 
as 
the 
preliminary 
transportation 
system

the

brought 
the 
city 
further 
national 
attention 
as

the

overshadowed

the

was 
further 
shaken 
by

shaken 
the

to 
its 
expansion 
the 
language 
spoken 
in 
shanghai 
was 
subordinate 
to 
those 
spoken 
around 
jiaxing 
and 
later 
suzhou 
and 
was 
known 
as 
the 
local 
tongue

being 
used

only 
in

shanghainese 
上海闲话 
appeared 
undergoing 
rapid

quickly 
replacing 
suzhounese 
as 
the 
prestige 
dialect 
of 
the 
yangtze 
river 
delta 
region 
at 
the 
time 
most 
of 
the 
citys 
residents 
were 
immigrants 
from 
the 
two 
adjacent 
provinces 
jiangsu 
and 
zhejiang 
so 
shanghainese 
was 
mostly 
a 
hybrid 
between 
southern 
jiangsu 
and 
ningbo 
dialects 
after 
1949 
putonghua 
has 
also 
had 
a 
great 
impact 
on 
shanghainese 
as 
a 
result 
of 
being 
rigorously 
promoted 
by 
the 
government 
since 
the 
1990s 
many 
migrants 
outside 
of 
the 
wuspeaking 
region 
have 
come 
to 
shanghai 
for 
education 
and 
jobs 
they 
often 
cannot 
speak 
the 
local 
language 
and 
therefore 
use 
putonghua 
as 
a 
lingua 
franca 
because 
putonghua 
and 
english 
were 
more 
favored 
shanghainese 
began 
to 
decline 
and 
fluency 
among 
young 
speakers 
weakened 
however 
in 
recent 
years 
there 
have 
been 
movements 
within 
the

to 
promote 
the

etymology 
there 
are 
various 
theories 
pertaining 
to 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
name

one 
plausible 
theory 
is 
that 
the 
word 
tehran 
is 
derived 
from 
tirantirgan 
the 
abode 
of 
tir 
tir 
being 
the 
zoroastrian 
deity 
equivalent 
to 
the 
greek 
deity 
mercury 
the 
ancient 
parthian 
town 
of 
tiran 
was 
a 
neighbour 
to 
the 
town 
of 
mehran

of

the 
zoroastrian 
sun 
god 
both 
of 
these 
were 
mere 
villages 
in 
the 
suburbs 
of 
the 
great 
city 
of 
rayrhages 
mehran 
is 
still 
extant 
and 
forms 
a 
residential 
district 
inside 
the 
greater 
tehran 
as 
is 
also 
ray—which 
forms 
the 
southern 
suburbs 
of 
tehrananother 
theory 
is 
that 
tehran 
means 
a 
warm 
place 
as 
opposed 
to 
a 
cool 
place 
eg 
shemiran—a 
cooler 
district 
in 
northern 
tehran 
some 
current 
texts 
in 
this 
regard 
claim 
that 
the 
word 
tehran 
in 
persian 
means 
warm 
mountain 
slope 
دامنه 
گرمthe 
official 
city 
of 
tehran 
website 
says 
that 
tehran 
comes 
from 
the 
persian 
words 
tah 
meaning 
end 
or 
bottom 
and 
ran 
meaning 
mountain 
slope—literally

tehrans 
geographic 
position 
at 
the 
bottom 
of

ordered

in

possibly 
to 
declare 
the

as 
the

mohammad 
khans 
choice 
of 
his 
capital 
was 
based 
on 
a 
similar 
concern 
for 
the 
control 
of 
both 
northern 
and 
southern 
iran 
he 
was 
aware 
of 
the 
loyalties 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
former 
capitals 
isfahan 
and 
shiraz 
to 
the 
safavid 
and

dynasties 
respectively 
and 
was 
wary 
of 
the 
power 
of 
the 
local 
notables 
in 
these 
cities 
thus 
he 
probably 
viewed 
tehrans 
lack 
of 
a 
substantial 
urban 
structure 
as 
a 
blessing 
because 
it 
minimized 
the 
chances 
of 
resistance 
to 
his 
rule 
by 
the 
notables 
and 
by

the

for

the

the

for

the

81

1967 
the 
seven 
smallest 
municipalities 
of

toronto 
were 
merged

following 
the 
elimination

by 
the 
late

toronto 
became 
a 
destination 
for 
immigrants 
from 
all

of 
the 
world 
by 
the 
1980s 
toronto 
had 
surpassed 
montreal 
as 
canadas 
most 
populous 
city 
and 
chief 
economic 
hub 
during 
this 
time 
in 
part 
owing 
to 
the 
political 
uncertainty 
raised 
by 
the 
resurgence 
of 
the 
quebec 
sovereignty 
movement 
many 
national

1998 
toronto 
was 
greatly 
enlarged 
not 
through 
traditional 
annexations 
but 
as 
an 
amalgamation 
of 
the 
municipality 
of 
metropolitan 
toronto 
and 
its 
six 
lowertier 
constituent 
municipalities 
east 
york 
etobicoke 
north

scarborough 
york 
and 
the 
original 
city 
itself 
they 
were 
dissolved 
by 
an 
act 
of 
the 
government 
of 
ontario 
and 
formed 
into 
a 
singletier 
city 
of 
toronto 
colloquially 
dubbed 
the 
megacity 
replacing 
all 
six 
governmentsthe 
merger 
was 
proposed 
as 
a 
costsaving 
measure 
by 
the 
progressive 
conservative 
provincial 
government 
under 
mike 
harris 
the 
announcement 
touched 
off 
vociferous 
public 
objections 
in 
march 
1997 
a 
referendum 
in 
all 
six 
municipalities 
produced 
a 
vote 
of 
more 
than 
3∶1 
against 
amalgamation 
however 
municipal 
governments 
in 
canada 
are 
creatures 
of 
the 
provincial 
governments 
and 
referendums 
have 
little 
to 
no 
legal 
effect 
the 
harris 
government 
could 
thus 
legally 
ignore 
the 
results 
of 
the 
referendum 
and 
did 
so 
in 
april 
when 
it 
tabled 
the 
city 
of 
toronto 
act 
both 
opposition 
parties 
held 
a 
filibuster 
in 
the 
provincial 
legislature 
proposing 
more 
than 
12000 
amendments 
that 
allowed 
residents 
on 
streets 
of 
the 
proposed 
megacity 
take 
part 
in 
public 
hearings 
on 
the 
merger 
and

yokohama 
was 
a 
small 
fishing 
village 
up 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
feudal 
edo 
period 
when 
japan 
held 
a 
policy 
of 
national 
seclusion 
having 
little 
contact 
with 
foreigners 
a 
major 
turning 
point 
in 
japanese 
history 
happened 
in 
185354 
when 
commodore 
matthew 
perry 
arrived 
just 
south 
of 
yokohama 
with 
a 
fleet 
of 
american 
warships 
demanding 
that 
japan 
open 
several 
ports 
for 
commerce 
and 
the 
tokugawa 
shogunate 
agreed 
by 
signing 
the 
treaty 
of 
peace 
and 
amityit 
was 
initially 
agreed 
that 
one 
of 
the 
ports 
to 
be 
opened 
to 
foreign 
ships 
would 
be

a 
strategic 
highway 
that 
linked 
edo 
to 
kyoto 
and 
osaka 
however 
the 
tokugawa 
shogunate 
decided 
that 
kanagawajuku 
was 
too 
close 
to 
the 
tōkaidō 
for 
comfort 
and 
port 
facilities 
were 
instead
